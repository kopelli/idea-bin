Some ideas are great for pet projects, some are great for making money, and some just have lessons to be discovered in their execution. This is a collection of ideas that may or may never get executed upon. Some may have already been executed upon, but just not widely known.

These ideas are being put out here because they have the potential to be useful/helpful projects, but execution of the idea could take some time. Like these quotes allude to, the idea alone doesn't bring value:
> "To me, ideas are worth nothing unless executed. They are just a multiplier. Execution is worth millions." – Steve Jobs
>
> "Genius is one percent inspiration and ninety-nine percent perspiration." - Thomas A. Edison

# Ideas

## Google Wave + Email

Google Wave was a great collaboration platform that was ahead of its time. It billed itself as an email-killer, but the problem is it was a closed garden. Allow participants to interact with the Wave via email as well as via Wave (or a federated Wave server).

## Growl For Windows (in NodeJS)

Try to re-implement Growl (and GNTP) support via NodeJS. Using [Electron](http://electron.atom.io/) could help bundle the packaging for deployment.

## Magic: the Gathering® Card Scanner

Set up a USB camera that you can "scan" MtG cards, run them through an OCR engine and catalog your collection. Bonus would be tapping into card pricing sites to determine high/low worth of the collection.

## Parenting Credit Card

Teach kids financial responsibility by giving them a "credit card" that isn't actually tied to a bank/financial account. If the kid wants to buy something they can't afford (while out with the parent), the site/app can help record how much the kid owes on the account. Let the parent decided if it accrues interest as well. Probably simplier algorithms for interest calculation that actual credit cards use. NO ACTUAL FINANCIAL ACCOUNTS SHOULD BE USED.

## Modular version of Masterplan

[Masterplan](http://www.habitualindolence.net/masterplan/) is a great tool for D&D campaign management and sessions, but it's only free (not open source), so modifying it to customize needs is a problem.

## TicGit In Powershell

[TicGit](https://github.com/schacon/ticgit) is an idea of ticket management in a Git repo as a baseless branch. Similar to gh-pages. The only issue is that it relied on Ruby to be available. This would support the same things TicGit did, but in a Powershell environment instead.

## Port SMAUG to...any other language

3D graphics, lengthy cut scenes, and rich audio of MMOs are nothing compared to a text-based MUD from back in the day. Playing a classic MUD based on [SMAUG](http://www.gammon.com.au/downloads/dlsmaug.htm) always brings back a sense of nostalgia. So with the power of new-ish programming languages, why not try porting the server to a different language.

## RSS Reader with AI assistance

It's easy to get overwhelmed by RSS feeds, so there should be an easier way to find the signal among the noise. Things like fetching all the content of an article if the feed is a truncated/alternative version of it; Pulling articles from link aggregation feeds; De-duplication of content if it surfaces from multiple feeds (or pulled as part of the link aggregation feeds); Estimated read times based on the user's past time spent on articles; User's interests, both from manually entering them and from the articles that the user opens to read.
